&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why MacBook speakers sound so much better than those in other laptops, &lt;strong&gt;especially&lt;/strong&gt; compared to the speakers of the 16-inch MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon? If you haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to hear them yet, my personal experience has been nothing but outrage at traditional laptop makers, as the speakers of the 16-inch MacBook Pro made other laptops feel irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, when I was evaluating my options for a new laptop, I thought about running Linux on an old(er) MacBook. I gave it a shot, and I immediately noticed how terrible the speakers sounded as soon as I booted from a live USB. I was confused â€” why do they sound so much worse than on macOS? That&amp;rsquo;s when I fell into the rabbit hole of audio effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
